# Advent of Code - Learning Zig

This project is dedicated to solving the Advent of Code challenges while learning the Zig programming language. Each directory represents a day of the challenge, with the corresponding Zig code stored in a `.zig` file.
It represents my learning path.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
- day1
  -- challenge.zig
- day2
  -- challenge.zig
```

- `day1/`: Contains the solution for day 1's challenge.
  - `challenge.zig`: Zig file with the solution for day 1's challenge.

- `day2/`: Contains the solution for day 2's challenge.
  - `challenge.zig`: Zig file with the solution for day 2's challenge.

## Usage Instructions

### Requirements

- [Install Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/)
- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-zig.git
cd advent-of-code-zig
```

### Compile and Run

To compile and run the challenges, navigate to the corresponding day's directory and compile the `.zig` file:

```bash
cd day1
zig run challenge.zig
./day1
```

Repeat the process for other days:

```bash
cd ../day2
zig run challenge.zig
./day2
```
